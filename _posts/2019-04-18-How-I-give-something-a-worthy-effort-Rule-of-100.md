I've had this "rule" for myself for quite a while and I've since heard from other people some variation of this (I think it was Alex Hormozi and Scott Galloway if I'm not wrong).

I have a confession to make: I've been a chronic starter for most of my life.

I've started a million things, many many more than I can remember. To name a short few: German language, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, shorthand writing, computer science studies, industrial design studies, and many more.

Blame my chronic perfectionism, or my deeply entrenched fear of failure. It doesn't matter.

I realised that in many cases, I would say "it just wasn't for me", or "it wasn't so interesting in the end".

I've seen this attitude time and again in myself and others.

Things were not "not for me".

I just wasn't willing to do the work, the follow through, the consistent practice.

Everything is lovely and exciting the first couple of times. Then the excitement wears off, and you just have to do the work.

So I developed a rule: I would not be allowed to say "I tried it" unless I'd done it at least 100 times.

Nowadays, it's okay for me to quit doing something even if I've done it only a few times.

But I don't allow myself to say that "I tried".

I say "I didn't give it a proper effort".

And that's okay.

But I'm never again confusing a half-assed effort with "it wasn't my thing".
